## ðŸ“œ Introduction

## :gear: Development

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

### Installation

Follow the next steps:

  - cd repository root
```bash
npm install
```
  - cd projects/ontimize-web-ngx-report
```bash
npm install
```

### Build

We have a script to build the library.

`npm run build`

It will create the distribution folder and pack this to use it as a npm package in a .tgz file but you can run those tasks separately.

The script `build` executes the following commands:

    - ng build
    - cd dist && npm pack (From the distribution folder we create a .tgz file to import in our project)
